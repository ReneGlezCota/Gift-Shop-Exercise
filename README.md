The first step to run this project is to install the dependencies it needs to run, these are defined in the *package.json* file, so you only need to execute:

`npm install`

Then you need to build the front-end pages using [bower](https://bower.io). To accomplish this you first need to open the *public* folder.
Once inside this folder you need to install the modules required for [bower](https://bower.io).

```
cd public
npm install
bower install
```
Then you need to build the back-end, run the script of PostgreSQL in the manager of postgresql.

Then to start the project go back to the root folder and use the start command for npm:

```
cd ..
npm start
```
